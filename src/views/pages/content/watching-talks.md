The live stream of talks will take place on here on our website.

You'll also be able to ask questions and show your appreciation on the live stream page.

## How do I show my appreciation at the end of the talk?

When we're physically together, everyone hears your clap in appreciation.

We've brought this experience online!

* Click on the Smiley Face widget in the bottom left corner of the window. The "Share how you feel!" dialog pops up.

* Click on any of the icons to show your appreciation. You (and all attendees) will hear your clap, and the widget keeps track of appreciations for that talk as well.

* To toggle the clapping audio on/off, see the `Clapping Audio` toggle in the top right of the window.

## Adjusting your view

To maximize the video window, you can hide the `Slack View` on the right, or the `Captions view` on the bottom. See the toggles in the top right of the window.

## How do I ask questions?

Ask a question in the Q&A widget on the left side of the window. Type your question, or up-vote an existing question.

## What is Talk Illustrations?

We've hired an artist to illustrate each talk.

## It would be nice to see the schedule!

Indeed! Our schedule is actually below the live talks though you may miss it because the video window auto-sizes. Just use the vertical scrollbar to scroll down to the schedule.
