The folks at Voicebox Karaoke are going to run a post-meetup karaoke party for us! A Zoom link will be emailed to you, so here's what you need to know to join us:

- Install Zoom (ðŸ˜‚)
- Join Zoom on a laptop or desktop (not mobile)
- Use a pair of headphones with a built in mic for best sound
- Have your smartphone handy because you will use this as a remote to browse songs & request songs.
